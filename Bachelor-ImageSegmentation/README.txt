This is the program accompanying the bachelor this of Songman Theodor Wöllmer, B.Sc. undergraduate of Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen.

This program has a built executable in Bachelor-ImageSegmentation/exc which should be able to be run.

Otherwise open the Bachelor-ImageSegmentation.sln with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and build it or debug it in there.

I hope the program works this way. If this is not the case, please contact me at:
